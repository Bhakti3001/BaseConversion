## Number System Conversion

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to convert numbers from one base to another, such as from the decimal base system to the binary base system or from the binary base system to the hexadecimal base system. When I was converting the numbers in one of my computer science courses, I ran into this project challenge. Digital systems need base conversions to function properly. As I can picture how the numbers would seem in systems other than the decimal system, I find this project to be interesting. To identify the conversions between particular systems, I will use various topics learned in the class for the remainder of the project.



##### Types of system that will be included in this project are : 
* 1) Binary (0-1)
* 2) Octal (0-7)
* 3) Decimal (0-9)
* 4) HexaDecimal (0-9 , A-F)


##### The project includes various topics learned throughout the course such as:
* 1) Selection Statements
* 2) Recursion
* 3) User Defined Functions
* 4) While/For Loops
* 5) List
* 6) Error Handling
